# ðŸ“˜ Discrete Mathematics â€” Rosen (8th Edition)

This folder contains my structured notes and exercises based on  
**Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications (8th ed.)** by Kenneth H. Rosen.

## ðŸ“š Study Approach

I'm working through the book chapter by chapter, solving exercises and writing LaTeX-based notes.  
Each topic is reinforced through a mix of proofs, examples, and code demos.
