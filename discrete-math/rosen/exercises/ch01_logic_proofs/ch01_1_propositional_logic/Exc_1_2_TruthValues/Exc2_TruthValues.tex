\subsubsection*{Exc 1.2: Which of these sentences are propositions? What are the
truth values of those that are propositions?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Do not pass go.
\item What time is it?
\item There are no black flies in Maine.
\item $4 + x = 5$
\item The moon is made of green cheese.
\item $2^n \geq 100$
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Solution:}
Propositions must have clearly defined truth values, so a proposition must be a declarative sentence with no
free variables:
\\
\textbf{a):} This is not a proposition; it’s a command.
\\
\textbf{b):} This is not a proposition; it’s a question.
\\
\textbf{c):} This is a proposition that is false.
\\
\textbf{d):} This is not a proposition; its truth value depends on the value of x.
\\
\textbf{e):} This is a proposition that is false.
\\
\textbf{f):} This is not a proposition; its truth value depends on the value of n.
