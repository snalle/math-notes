\subsubsection*{Exc 1.1: Which of these sentences are propositions? What are the
truth values of those that are propositions?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Boston is the capital of Massachusetts.
\item Miami is the capital of Florida.
\item $2+3=5$
\item $5+7=10$
\item $x+2 = 11$
\item Answer this question.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Solution:}
Propositions must have clearly defined truth values, so a proposition must be a declarative sentence with no
free variables:
\\
\textbf{a):} This is a proposition that is true.
\\
\textbf{b):} This is a proposition that is false.
\\
\textbf{c):} This is a proposition that is true.
\\
\textbf{d):} This is a proposition that is false.
\\
\textbf{e):} This is not a proposition; its truth value depends on the value of x.
\\
\textbf{f):} This is not a proposition; itâ€™s a command.
