\subsubsection*{Exc 1.7: What is the negation of each of these propositions?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Steve has more than 100 GB free disk space on his
laptop.
\item Zach blocks e-mails and texts from Jennifer.
\item $7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 999$
\item Diane rode her bicycle 100 miles on Sunday.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Solution:}
\\
\textbf{a):} Steve has at most 100 GB free disk space on this laptop.
\\ Alt: Steve has 100 GB or less free disk space on his laptop.
\\ Alt2: Steve does not have more than 100 GB free disk space on his laptop
\\
\textbf{b):} Zach does not block emails or does not block texts from Jeniffer.
\\ Alt: Zach doesn’t block both emails and texts from Jeniffer (natural language)
\\ Same as in \textbf{Exercise 1.5 d)}
\\ $P = \text{Zach blocks emails from Jennifer}$ and  $Q = \text{Zach blocks texts from Jennifer}$. So original statement is a conjunction between $P$ and $Q$ written as $P \land Q$. 
\\ The negation of the conjuction is (via DeMorgan´s Laws);
\begin{equation*}
\neg (P \land Q) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg Q    
\end{equation*}
So verbal negation becomes: \textit{Zach does not block emails or does not block texts from Jeniffer}
\\
\textbf{c):} $7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \neq 999$
\\
\textbf{d):} Diane did not ride her bicycle 100 miles on Sunday.
\\ Alt: Diane rode less than or more than 100 miles on Sunday
