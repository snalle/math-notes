# Chapter 2: Basic Structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums, and Matrices (pg. 121-193)

This chapter introduces foundational mathematical structures that serve as essential tools for data science, computer science, and discrete mathematics. You’ll learn to reason about collections of data, map relationships, analyze patterns, and perform transformations — both theoretical and computational.

## 📘 Chapter Overview

The chapter is divided into the following main subchapters:

### 🔹 2.1: Sets (pg. 121–131)

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects. This section introduces how to define, describe, and reason about sets. Topics include:

- Roster and set-builder notation
- Membership and subset relations
- Power sets and Cartesian products
- Common sets (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ)
- Applications to classification and search

### 🔹 2.2: Set Operations (pg. 133–144)

Builds on basic set definitions by introducing operations and laws for manipulating sets.

- Union, intersection, difference, complement
- Venn diagrams for visualization
- Laws of set theory (associative, distributive, De Morgan's)
- Applications to logic and probability

### 🔹 2.3: Functions (pg. 147–161)

Functions describe relationships between sets, mapping inputs to outputs in a structured way.

- Definitions: domain, codomain, range
- One-to-one, onto, and bijective functions
- Composition and inverse functions
- Identity function, floor/ceiling
- Applications to hashing and transformations

### 🔹 2.4: Sequences and Summations (pg. 165–177)

Sequences represent ordered lists of elements, and summations provide concise notation for aggregation.

- Arithmetic and geometric sequences
- Summation notation and formulas
- Manipulating indices
- Common sums: integers, squares, powers of 2
- Nested summations and series

### 🔹 2.5: Cardinality of Sets (pg. 179-186)

Cardinality measures the "size" of sets and distinguishes between finite and infinite sets.

- Countable vs. uncountable sets
- One-to-one correspondences
- Cantor’s diagonalization
- Pigeonhole principle
- Finite vs. infinite classifications

### 🔹 2.6: Matrices (pg. 188-193)

Matrices organize data in rows and columns and support operations essential for linear algebra, data manipulation, and system modeling.

- Matrix definitions, dimensions
- Matrix addition and scalar multiplication
- Matrix multiplication
- Zero and identity matrices
- Transposition
- Boolean matrices and adjacency representations
