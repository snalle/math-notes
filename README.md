# ðŸ“˜ Discrete Mathematics

This folder contains my structured notes and exercises from **Discrete Mathematics**, primarily based on:

- *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications (8th ed.)* by Kenneth Rosen  
- *Planned:* *Schaum's Outline of Discrete Mathematics (4th ed.)* by Seymour Lipschutz & Marc Lipson  
- *Planned:* *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd ed.)* by Ronald Graham, Donald Knuth & Oren Patashnik

These books are referenced as:
- **Rosen** â€” comprehensive and textbook-standard, covering all foundational topics
- **Schaumâ€™s** â€” excellent for additional problem-solving practice
- **Knuth (Concrete Mathematics)** â€” deeper mathematical insight and combinatorial problem-solving

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each book has its own folder (e.g. `rosen/`) with the following structure:

```
rosen/
â”œâ”€â”€ notes/ # LaTeX-written theoretical notes
â”œâ”€â”€ exercises/ # LaTeX-written problem solutions
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks (logic, counting, graphs, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/ # R Markdown chapter summaries or reviews
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/ # Compiled PDFs or exported versions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

I'm working through Discrete Math to strengthen my foundation for data science, algorithms, and machine learning. Each topic is paired with exercises, code demos, and summaries.
